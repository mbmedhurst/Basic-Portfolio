            <p class="justified-text">I was born and raised in Los Angeles. As an adult I’ve lived in San Diego, the UK
                (Oxford and London) and currently I’m living in Orange County, CA.</p>
            <p class="justified-text">I have a Masters degree in English Literature, which I loved studying in college.
                But my career took me in a different direction. For the last 25 years I’ve worked in business systems
                development, including technical support, training, writing user guides, business analysis, user
                acceptance and usability testing, and now as a developer.</p>
            <p class="justified-text">In my life away from my computer I enjoy traveling, cooking, watching Dodger
                baseball and paddle boarding with my dog.</p>
