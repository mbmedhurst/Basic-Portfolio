            <p class="justified-text">I'm originally from Los Angeles but have spent the better part of my adult life
                moving from one place to another, including San Diego and the UK
                (Oxford and London). I've been back in beautiful SoCal for about five years.</p>
            <p class="justified-text">I have a Masters degree in English Literature, which I loved studying in college.
                But once I started working I went in a bit of a different direction. For the last 25 years I’ve worked
                with business systems
                in various roles, including technical support, training, writing user guides, business analysis, user
                acceptance and usability testing, and now - finally - as a developer.</p>
            <p class="justified-text">In my life away from my computer I enjoy traveling, cooking, watching Dodger
                baseball and paddle boarding with my dog.</p>
